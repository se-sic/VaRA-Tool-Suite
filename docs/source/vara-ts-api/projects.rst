Projects
========

A *project* is an abstraction of a software project containing information on
how to build and execute that software project.
The tool suite already ships with some projects,
but also allows you to add new ones.

* :ref:`List of supported projects`


How to add a new project to VaRA-TS
-----------------------------------

To add a new project, create a new class with ``benchbuild.Project``
as its superclass.
Place the class in one of the ``varats/projects/<group>`` folders, where
``<group>`` refers to the language of the project.

Additionally, add the project to the ``bb_config.py`` file in ``varats/tools``.

Below, you can see a simplified version of the project *Gravity* with comments
explaining the different parts of the project definition. You can use this as a
template for your own project::

    import typing as tp

    import benchbuild as bb
    from benchbuild.utils.cmd import make
    from benchbuild.utils.settings import get_number_of_jobs
    from plumbum import local

    from varats.paper.paper_config import PaperConfigSpecificGit
    from varats.utils.settings import bb_cfg
    from varats.project.project_util import (
        ProjectBinaryWrapper,
        wrap_paths_to_binaries,
        verify_binaries,
    )

    class Gravity(bb.Project, CVEProviderHook):  # type: ignore
        """Programming language Gravity."""

        NAME = 'gravity'      # The name of the project
        GROUP = 'c_projects'  # The group this project belongs to
        DOMAIN = 'language'   # The application domain of this project

        SOURCE = [
            PaperConfigSpecificGit(
              "gravity",
              remote="https://github.com/marcobambini/gravity.git",
              local="gravity",
              refspec="origin/HEAD",
              limit=None,
              shallow=False
            )
        ]

        @property
        def binaries(self) -> tp.List[ProjectBinaryWrapper]:
            """Return a list of binaries generated by the project."""
            return wrap_paths_to_binaries(["gravity"])

        def run_tests(self) -> None:
            """ This function defines tests and benchmarks for the project. """
            pass

        def compile(self) -> None:
            """ Contains instructions on how to build the project. """

            gravity_version_source = local.path(self.source_of(self.primary_source))
            clang = bb.compiler.cc(self)
            with local.cwd(gravity_version_source):
                with local.env(CC=str(clang)):
                    bb.watch(make)("-j", get_number_of_jobs(bb_cfg()))

                verify_binaries(self)


.. note::

    Some projects change their build system at some point in time. In such
    cases, you could check which version you are currently compiling and
    dispatch the build process to a more specific build function.
    For an example, have a look at the real
    :class:`Gravity<varats.projects.c_projects.gravity.Gravity>` project.


Specifying Project Binaries
...........................

The :func:`~varats.project.project_util.ProjectBinaryWrapper.binaries` property
of a ``Project`` exports a list of binaries built by the project, specifying
the relative path from the project root to the created binary.  When queried by
an analysis, a list of
:class:`~varats.project.project_util.ProjectBinaryWrapper`\ s is returned,
where every wrapper specifies the name, location of the binary, and the
:class:`~varats.project.project_util.BinaryType`.
To guarantee that all specified binaries were produced during compilation, one
should add a :func:`~varats.project.project_util.verify_binaries` call after
the compilation is done.
In our example, the :func:`~varats.project.project_util.verify_binaries` call
is directly after the call to `make` and still located within the
`gravity_version_source` context, meaning the execution is still in the
projects source folder.

Binary wrappers can be created automatically with the provided helper functions
:class:`~varats.project.project_util.wrap_paths_to_binaries` or
:class:`~varats.project.project_util.wrap_paths_to_binaries_with_name`.

Furthermore, keep in mind that, for some projects, binary locations change during
project life time.  To specify a specific binary locations for a range of
project revisions use ``benchbuild.utils.revision_ranges``.

Blocking revisions
..................

It will happen that some revisions of a project fail to build because of missing
dependencies or because of a bug in the project sources.
The tool suite provides a facility to mark such revisions and block them from
further experiments.

This can be done with benchbuild's ``block_revisions`` source declaration decorator.
This decorator allows you to block single revisions or larger ranges of
revisions.

To block revisions, just add the ``block_revisions`` decorator around a git source declaration::

    from benchbuild.utils.revision_ranges import (
        block_revisions,
        GoodBadSubgraph,
        RevisionRange,
        SingleRevision,
    )

    ...

    SOURCE = [
        block_revisions([
            RevisionRange(
                "0b8e0e047fc3d5e18ead3221ad54920f1ad0eedc",
                "8f417752dd14deea64249b5d32b6138ebc877fa9", "nothing to build"
            ),
            GoodBadSubgraph(["e8999a84efbd9c3e739bff7af39500d14e61bfbc"],
                            ["0e918ce0798407dd6c981e1cd26b4ba138d22fab"],
                            "missing -lm"),
            GoodBadSubgraph(["244c5aa91358a5b2472d351e6c7f38ba7da94ef6"],
                            ["371152de2f38534d4da332349d1def83fc66d5bc"],
                            "Visual studio project breaks makefile"),
            GoodBadSubgraph(["112be515b5ef3b67011c7272e5a50ac3a1fcadc4"],
                            ["b9a62dfad41ae06d029493cf4d5757de2a0281b2"],
                            "bug in gravity"),
            SingleRevision(
                "e207f0cc87bf57e9ccb6f0d18ff4fe4d6ef0c096", "bug in gravity"
            ),
            GoodBadSubgraph(["d2a04f92347fb5f2b6fd23bea9b0e12817cd6d8e"],
                            ["e8fbd6a4a2a9618456f1460dc9138b617dc7af4b"],
                            "bug in gravity"),
            GoodBadSubgraph(["968534c5d4f28501b7f34da48cab2c153ae7449b"],
                            ["0caf15328bda90ffb1911077e03b28ea9970208b"],
                            "bug in gravity"),
            GoodBadSubgraph(["e4f95e669a4c5cf2d142d5b0b72a11c117f7092f"],
                            ["09e59da4deff9b35224f4784fae9d0f132be9cea"],
                            "missing -lbsd"),
        ])(
            PaperConfigSpecificGit(
                "gravity",
                remote="https://github.com/marcobambini/gravity.git",
                local="gravity",
                refspec="origin/HEAD",
                limit=None,
                shallow=False
            )
        )
    ]


The decorator takes a list of revision ranges as argument.
There are three different kinds of revision ranges:

- ``SingleRevision``: a single revision
- ``RevisionRange``: all revisions that lie between the two
  given revisions ``start`` and ``end``, i.e., all revisions in the output of
  ``git log --pretty=%H --ancestry-path start..end``
- ``GoodBadSubgraph``: blocks all revisions that contain a ``bad`` commit
  but no ``good`` commit

Each revision range can be annotated with a comment to keep track or the reason
why the revisions were blocked.
This helps not only when reasoning about the validity of experiments, but it
also makes it easier to see whether a block can be fixed in the future
(e.g., missing dependencies could be resolved by a containerized execution
environment).


Using Containers
................

To use a project with our :ref:`container support <Container Guide>` it has to declare which container image to use.
This can be done by assigning a container image to the `CONTAINER` class variable::

    CONTAINER = get_base_image(ImageBase.DEBIAN_10)

To ensure that the container already contains everything required by BenchBuild, you should use one of our base images using the function :func:`~varats.containers.containers.get_base_image()`. You can then add additional layers to the image using BenchBuild's buildah API.
For example, you can create a container based on our Debian 10 base image and install `wget` like this::

    get_base_image(ImageBase.DEBIAN_10).run("apt", "install", "-y", "wget")

For some projects, you may want to use different container images based on the project revision.
This can be achieved by assigning `CONTAINER` a list of `(RevisionRange, ContainerImage)` tuples.
