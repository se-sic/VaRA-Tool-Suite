How to use case studies
-----------------------
If one wants to analyze a particular set of revisions or wants to re-evaluate the same revision over and over again, we can fixate the revisions we are interested in by creating a :class:`CaseStudy`. First, create a folder, where your config should be saved. Then, create a case study that specifies the revision to be analyzed. In order to ease the creation of case studies the tool suite offers different sampling methods to choose revisions from the projects history based on a probability distribution.

For example, we can generate a new case study for ``gzip``, drawing 10 revision from the projects history based on a half-normal distribution, with::

    vara-cs gen PATH_TO_PAPER_CONF_DIR/ half_norm PATH_TO_REPO/ --num-rev 10

Created case studies should be grouped into folders, e.g., a set of case studies used for a paper, called paper config.
For more information see :ref:`How to use paper configs`.

Extending case studies
......................
Case studies group together revisions but sometimes these groups need to be changed or extended, e.g., when we want to sample a few more revisions to gather data for a specific revision range. To simplify that, our tool suite provides :ref:`vara-cs ext`, a tool for extending and changing case studies.

For example::

    vara-cs ext paper_configs/ase-17/gzip_0.case_study distrib_add gzip/ --distribution uniform --num-rev 5

will add 5 new revision, sampled uniformly from all revisions, to the case study.

In more detail, case studies have different stages that are separated from each other. This allows us, for example, to extend a case study with a specific revision without changing the initial set of revisions, e.g., stage 0.

For example::

    vara-cs ext paper_configs/ase-17/gzip_0.case_study simple_add gzip/ --extra-revs 0dd8313ea7bce --merge-stage 3

will add revision ``0dd8313ea7bce`` to the stage 3 of the gzip case study, allowing us to analyze it and draw different plots, e.g., one containing only stage 0 data and another with all stages included

This allows the tool suite to tell BenchBuild which revisions should be analyzed to evaluate a set of case studies for a paper. For example, a setup could look like::

    paper_configs
        ├── ase-17
        │       ├── gzip_0.case_study
        │       ├── gzip_1.case_study
        │       └── git_0.case_study
        └── icse-18
                ├── gzip_0.case_study
                └── git_0.case_study

In this example, we got two paper configs, one for ``ase-17`` another for ``icse-18``. We see different case studies for ``gzip`` and ``git``, notice here that we can create multiple case studies for one project. If we now want to evaluate our set for ``icse-18`` we set the paper-config folder to the root of our config tree and select the ``icse-18`` folder as our current config, like this::

    paper_config:
    current_config:
        value: icse-18
    folder:
        value: /home/foo/vara/paper_configs/

Next, we can run our experiment with BenchBuild as usual. During experiment execution, BenchBuild will load our config and only evaluate the needed revisions.

The current status of a case study can be visualized with :ref:`vara-cs status`::

    >>> vara-cs status -s
    CS: gzip_0: (0/5) processed
    CS: gzip_1: (2/5) processed
    CS: gzip_2: (5/5) processed
    CS: libvpx_0: (0/5) processed
