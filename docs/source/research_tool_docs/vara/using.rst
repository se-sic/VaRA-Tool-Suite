How to use VaRA (Overview)
**************************

Overall, VaRA is build for two different usage scenarios:

* Running a static analysis to directly generate analysis result either during compile time or in a post processing step.
* Running a dynamic analysis, by instrumeting the binary during compile time and then later producing the analysis data during execution.

Currently, VaRA implements two high-level concepts and some accompanying analysis pipelines for them, one for analyzing repository meta-data and on for analyzing software features, both are described below in more detail.
