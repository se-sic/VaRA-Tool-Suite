Running experiments with BenchBuild
===================================

VaRA-TS provides different preconfigured experiments and projects.
In order to execute an experiment on a project we use `BenchBuild <https://github.com/PolyJIT/benchbuild>`_, an empirical-research toolkit.

Setup: Configuring BenchBuild
-----------------------------
First, we need to generate a folder with a configuration file for BenchBuild in the vara root directory. This is done with:

.. code-block:: bash

  vara-gen-bbconfig

Running BenchBuild experiments
----------------------------------
Second, we change into the benchbuild folder and run an experiment that generates `BlameReports` for provided projects. In this case we use `gzip`.

.. code-block:: bash

  cd $VARA_ROOT/benchbuild
  benchbuild -vv run -E GenerateBlameReport gzip

The generated result files are place in the ``vara/results/$PROJECT_NAME`` folder and can be further visualized with VaRA-TS graph generators.

How-to configure BenchBuild yourself
------------------------------------
BenchBuild's configuration file ``.benchbuild.yml`` normally is placed inside the ``benchbuild`` folder, which is located in the vara root folder.
A default version of this file can be automatically generated with our tool :ref:`vara-gen-bbconfig`.
To adapt and tune BenchBuild further, you can moify the different configuration flags in this config file. The following list shows the most important ones:

* Adding extra paths to the environment

.. code-block:: yaml

  env:
    path:
      value: ["paths from your system that should be included in the PATH variable for experiments"]

* Other experiments or projects can be loaded similar to python imports

.. code-block:: yaml

  plugins:
  experiments:
    default:
      - varats.vara-experiments.CommitAnnotationReport
      - varats.vara-experiments.RegionAnalyser
  projects:
    default:
      - varats.vara-projects.git.gzip
      - pythonmodule.projectclass

* Enable/Disable BenchBuild version support, i.e., let BB consider all revisions from a project or just the latest one.

.. code-block:: yaml

  versions:
    full:
      default: false
      desc: Ignore default sampling and provide full version exploration.
      value: true

* Adapt the number of threads that should be used for project compilation.

.. code-block:: yaml

  jobs:
    desc: Number of jobs that can be used for building and running.
    value: '4'

* Adapt the number of parallel running experiment executions.

.. code-block:: yaml

  parallel_processes:
    desc: Proccesses use to work on execution plans.
    value: 4
