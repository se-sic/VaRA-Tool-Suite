Running experiments with BenchBuild
===================================

.. note::
    This section describes how to directly work with benchbuild and is intended for advanced users.
    For the standard use-case see our :ref:`tutorial on running experiments <Running Experiments>`.

VaRA-TS provides different preconfigured experiments and projects.
In order to execute an experiment on a project we use `BenchBuild <https://github.com/PolyJIT/benchbuild>`_, an empirical-research toolkit.

Setup: Configuring BenchBuild
-----------------------------
First, we need to generate a folder with a configuration file for BenchBuild in the VaRA-TS root directory. This is done with:

.. code-block:: bash

  vara-gen-bbconfig

Running BenchBuild experiments
------------------------------
Second, we change into the benchbuild folder and run an experiment that generates `BlameReports` for provided projects. In this case we use `gzip`.

.. code-block:: bash

  cd $VARA_ROOT/benchbuild
  benchbuild -vv run -E GenerateBlameReport gzip

The generated result files are placed in the ``varats/results/$PROJECT_NAME`` folder and can later be visualized with :ref:`plots or tables<Visualizing Data>`.

Running BenchBuild outside the ``$VARA_ROOT/benchbuild`` directory
------------------------------------------------------------------
To execute BenchBuild from another directory the ``VARA_ROOT`` environment variable must be set, so varats and benchbuild can locate the varats configuration file.

.. code-block:: bash

  # temporary:
  export VARA_ROOT=/path/to/your/varats/root/directory
  # permanent:
  echo 'export VARA_ROOT=/path/to/your/varats/root/directory' >> ~/.$(basename $0)rc

How-to configure BenchBuild yourself
------------------------------------
BenchBuild's configuration file ``.benchbuild.yml`` normally is placed inside the ``benchbuild`` folder, which is located in the varats root folder.
A default version of this file can be automatically generated with our tool :ref:`vara-gen-bbconfig`.
To adapt and tune BenchBuild further, you can modify the different configuration flags in this config file. The following list shows the most important ones:

* Adding extra paths to the environment

.. code-block:: yaml

  env:
    path:
      value: ["paths from your system that should be included in the PATH variable for experiments"]

* Other experiments or projects can be loaded similar to python imports

.. code-block:: yaml

  plugins:
  experiments:
    default:
      - varats.vara-experiments.CommitAnnotationReport
      - varats.vara-experiments.RegionAnalyser
  projects:
    default:
      - varats.vara-projects.git.gzip
      - pythonmodule.projectclass

* Enable/Disable BenchBuild version support, i.e., let BB consider all revisions from a project or just the latest one.

.. code-block:: yaml

  versions:
    full:
      default: false
      desc: Ignore default sampling and provide full version exploration.
      value: true

* Adapt the number of threads that should be used for project compilation.

.. code-block:: yaml

  jobs:
    desc: Number of jobs that can be used for building and running.
    value: '4'

* Adapt the number of parallel running experiment executions.

.. code-block:: yaml

  parallel_processes:
    desc: Proccesses use to work on execution plans.
    value: 4

Running BenchBuild in a Container
---------------------------------

.. note::

  In this section, every occurrence of ``$VARATS_ROOT`` should be replaced with the path to your VaRA-TS root directory.

BenchBuild can run its experiments inside a container.
This allows to customize the execution environment on a per-project(-version) and per-experiment level.

Configuring the Container Support
.................................

To use BenchBuild's container support, you first need to setup `buildah <https://github.com/containers/buildah/blob/master/install.md>`_ and `podman <https://podman.io/getting-started/installation>`_ on your system.
Please follow their install instructions on how to setup both tools.
We highly recommend to use buildah and podman in rootless mode, which requires a subuid and subgid mapping on all machines and for all users that need to run containers.
More details can be found `here <https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md>`_.
You also need to install `crun` on those machines.
For debian, this can be don with the following command::

    sudo apt install crun

Then, make sure that the following parameters are set in the :ref:`BenchBuild config <How-to configure BenchBuild yourself>`.
If you generated your configuration via :ref:`vara-gen-bbconfig`, these options were set automatically.

.. code-block:: yaml

  container:
    export:
      desc: Export path for container images.
      value: !create-if-needed '$VARATS_ROOT/containers/export'
    from_source:
      desc: Install BenchBuild from source or from pip (default)
      value: false
    import:
      desc: Import path for container images.
      value: !create-if-needed '$VARATS_ROOT/containers/export'
    interactive:
      desc: Drop into an interactive shell for all container runs.
      value: false
    keep:
      desc: Keep failed image builds at their last known good state.
      value: false
    keep_suffix:
      desc: Suffix to add to failed image builds, if we keep them.
      value: failed
    mounts:
      desc: List of paths that will be mounted inside the container.
      value:
        - [$VARATS_ROOT/results, /varats_root/results]
        - [$VARATS_ROOT/benchbuild/BC_files, /varats_root/BC_files]
        - [$VARATS_ROOT/varats/paper_configs, /varats_root/paper_configs]
    replace:
      desc: Replace existing container images.
      value: false
    root:
      desc: Permanent storage for container images
      value: !create-if-needed '$VARATS_ROOT/containers/lib'
    runroot:
      desc: Runtime storage for containers
      value: !create-if-needed '$VARATS_ROOT/containers/run'
    runtime:
      desc: Default container runtime used by podman
      value: /usr/bin/crun
    shell:
      desc: Command string that should be used as shell command.
      value: /bin/bash
    source:
      desc: Path to benchbuild's source directory
      value: '</path/to/benchbuild>'


Executing Experiments in a Container
....................................

If your experiment makes use of a :ref:`research tool <Provided research tools>`, the next step is to set up the correct research tool for your experiment.
Afterwards, you need to build the base containers.
This process is explained step-by-step in our :ref:`container guide<Container Guide>`.

You can now run your experiments in a container using ``vara-run --container`` or,  when using BenchBuild directly, by replacing the ``run`` in your BenchBuild command with ``container run``, for example, like this:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd $VARA_ROOT/benchbuild
  benchbuild -vv container run -E GenerateBlameReport gzip

Note, that each project is responsible for providing a :ref:`base container image <Using Containers>` to run in.

.. warning::

  BenchBuild configuration values are not automatically propagated into the container.
  If a specific value is needed either the base image needs to provide it or the project/experiment needs to add the specific BenchBuild environment variable to its layer.

Using buildah and podman on the Commandline
...........................................

For more advanced users, it might be useful to work with buildah and podman directly from the commandline, e.g., when debugging container images.
In these situations, it can come in handy to create some shell aliases that set the correct `root` and `runroot` to for the buildah and podman commands, as well as the `storage_driver` that is set in BenchBuild's config file::

    alias bbuildah='buildah --root $VARATS_ROOT/containers/lib --runroot $VARATS_ROOT/containers/run --storage-driver=vfs'
    alias bpodman='podman --root $VARATS_ROOT/containers/lib --runroot $VARATS_ROOT/containers/run --storage-driver=vfs'


Debugging Container Images
..........................

BenchBuild has some configuration options that support debugging container images.
If you set the config option ``container/keep`` to ``true`` you will be dropped into buildah build container if building an image fails.

.. code-block:: yaml

  container:
    keep:
      desc: Keep failed image builds at their last known good state.
      value: true
    keep_suffix:
      desc: Suffix to add to failed image builds, if we keep them.
      value: failed


As an alternative, you can also mount the file system of a container image by following these steps:

1. Create a buildah unshare session with

   .. code-block:: bash

     buildah unshare

   This creates an environment where it looks like if you were root.
2. Create the ``bbuildah`` alias (the unshare environment does not know the alias yet, even if it was set in the shell where you executed ``buildah unshare``).
3. Create a working container from the desired image with

   .. code-block:: bash

     newcontainer=$(bbuildah from <image_id>)

   This command will print a container id.
4. Mount the working container (identified by the id you got from the step before) with

   .. code-block:: bash

     containermnt=$(bbuildah mount $newcontainer)

   Container's file system is now available at ``$containermnt``.
5. After you are done, unmount the container's file system with

   .. code-block:: bash

     bbuildah umount $newcontainer

6. Delete the working container with

   .. code-block:: bash

     bbuildah rm $newcontainer

7. Exit the buildah unshare session by typing ``exit``

Alternatively, you can spawn a shell (e.g., bash) in the container by executing the following command after step 3:

.. code-block:: bash

  bbuildah run $newcontainer bash

Depending on your concrete setup, it might not be necessary to do this in an buildah unshare session.
