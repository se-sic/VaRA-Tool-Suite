Build VaRA with vara-buildsetup
===============================

:ref:`vara-buildsetup` is the tool used to install and build VaRA.


Installation
------------

Install dependencies
********************

To use the VaRA Tool Suite, your system has to have at least `python3.7`. Make sure you have the necessary packages installed.

For ubuntu:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo apt install python3-dev python3-tk python3-psutil psutils ninja-build python3-pip autoconf cmake ruby curl time libyaml-dev git graphviz-dev
    sudo apt install python3-venv # If you want to install VaRA-TS in a python virtualenv

For arch:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo pacman -Syu --needed python tk python-psutil psutils ninja python-pip python-statsmodels autoconf cmake ruby curl time libyaml python-coverage graphviz

For fedora:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo dnf install python3-devel python3-tkinter python3-psutil psutils ninja-build python3-pip autoconf cmake ruby curl time libyaml-devel gcc-c++ libgit2-devel gcc-gfortran openblas-devel graphviz-devel

Install to varats with pip
**************************

Then, the simplest way to install VaRA-TS is by using pip.

.. code-block:: console

    pip3 install varats


Making an editable install from source to python user-directory (easier)
************************************************************************

First, you need to clone the VaRA-Tool-Suite repository.

.. code-block:: console

    git clone git@github.com:se-sic/VaRA-Tool-Suite.git
    cd VaRA-Tool-Suite


To install VaRA-TS from the repository into the user directory use the
following command.  The same command can be used to update an existing
installation (if necessary).

.. code-block:: console

    # cd to VaRA-TS directory
    python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade -e varats

    # developers also need to execute the next command
    # (if you want to contribute to VaRA/VaRA-TS):
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

This initializes `VaRA-TS` and installs a collection of helpful :ref:`tools <Tools Overview>`, e.g., to produce and visualize VaRA results.

Install to python virtualenv (advanced)
***************************************

.. code-block:: console

    # create virtualenv
    python3 -m venv /where/you/want/your/virtualenv/to/live

    # activate virtualenv
    source /path/to/virtualenv/bin/activate

    # cd to VaRA-TS directory
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade -e varats

    # developers also need to execute the next command
    # (if you want to contribute to VaRA/VaRA-TS):
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

The virtualenv method has the advantage that it does not mess with your local python user
directory. With this method you have to execute the `source` command every time before
you can execute the `vara-graphview` program.

Usage
-----

Install VaRA
************

Required system dependencies for building VaRA.

.. include:: vara_install_requirements.inc

The following example shows how to setup VaRA via command line.

.. code-block:: console

    mkdir $VARA_ROOT
    cd $VARA_ROOT
    vara-buildsetup init vara
    vara-buildsetup build vara

Update VaRA
***********

Updating VaRA to a new version can also be done with `vara-buildsetup`.

.. code-block:: console

    vara-buildsetup update vara
    vara-buildsetup build vara

Upgrading VaRA
**************

To upgrade VaRA to a new release, for example, `release_70`, use:

.. code-block:: console

    vara-buildsetup update vara --version 110


VaRA Container build
********************

If you want to :ref:`run your experiments in a container <Running benchbuild in a container>`, you have to compile VaRA specifically for the used container environment.
This can be done by specifying the ``--container=<base_container>`` flag when building VaRA.
You have to compile VaRA for each :ref:`base image <Using containers>` you use in your experiments.

Debugging
---------

Per default, `vara-buildsetup` doesn't provide debug output. When working on VaRA, it
is helpful to get some debug output when building it. For example to know, if the current
build fails.

To get debug output set the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `debug`.

.. code-block:: console

    # for the entire section
    export LOG_LEVEL=devel

    # just then running vara-buildsetup
    LOG_LEVEL=debug vara-buildsetup vara -b

Post-installation
-----------------

After having compiled VaRA, update the `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables to
use the just compiled VaRA build instead of your system clang install.

.. code-block:: console

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$VARA_ROOT/tools/VaRA/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export PATH=$VARA_ROOT/tools/VaRA/bin:$PATH
